# NMG Identity Automation

PowerShell tools for finding and managing stale accounts in Active Directory.
Built during the TotalThreat 30-Day Challenge in a simulated healthcare
environment. Northstar Medical Group is a fictional organization.

## The Problem

At Northstar, offboarding depended on one person emailing IT whenever
someone left. When she retired, those emails stopped, and for 102 days
nobody noticed that departed employees still had working accounts.

A manual review eventually compared Active Directory against payroll and
found 23 stale accounts. It took 11 hours, and it still had a blind spot:
it could only find what had been recorded. Contractors who were never on
payroll, departures nobody filed, and service accounts that were never
people at all couldn't show up in that comparison.

## The Approach

Instead of trusting the paperwork, I asked the domain controller directly.
Every account has a LastLogonDate showing when it last authenticated, and
that value doesn't depend on HR records or names matching between systems.

Running this against the directory found 14 accounts that were dormant
for 90+ days and still enabled, none of which the manual review had caught.

The goal is to find first and fix later. These tools report on accounts;
they don't change them. Disabling accounts without a documented process is
how a small problem turns into an outage.

## Before you start

- Windows Server with the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module

      Import-Module ActiveDirectory

- Rights to modify user objects in the domain
- An authorising ticket number, in the form NMG-0000
- A Disabled Users OU at the root of the domain
- A writable reports folder. Create it if it does not exist:

      New-Item -Path "C:\Reports\Offboarding" -ItemType Directory -Force

## Tools

### Find-StaleAccounts.ps1

Finds enabled accounts that haven't logged in within a set number of days,
including accounts that have never logged in at all. Saves a timestamped
CSV report and a summary file showing the exact query used, so anyone can
reproduce the results.

    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 30
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 180 -IncludeDisabled

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Days` | int | 90 | Days without a login before an account counts as stale |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports | Folder where reports are saved |
| `-IncludeDisabled` | switch | off | Also include disabled accounts |

Run `Get-Help .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Full` for full documentation.


### Offboard-NMGUser.ps1

Performs all five steps of SOP-IAM-001 against a single account.
Documents the account and its group memberships, verifies that
record on disk, disables the account, stamps the authorising
ticket, removes all group memberships, and moves the account to
the Disabled Users OU.

    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214" -WhatIf
    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214"

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Username` | string | required | SamAccountName of the account to offboard |
| `-Ticket` | string | required | Authorising ticket, in the form NMG-0000 |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports\Offboarding | Where evidence files are written |
| `-LogPath` | string | Logs\ | Where the run transcript is written |
| `-WhatIf` | switch | off | Runs every check and changes nothing |

**Output:** two timestamped CSV files per account recording what
it was and what it could reach, plus a transcript of the run.

### Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1

Reports how many accounts have been offboarded and quarantined,
how many are offboarded but not yet moved, and how many are still
waiting. Takes no parameters and makes no changes of any kind.

    .\Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1

**Output:** three counts and two named lists, printed to the
console. Nothing is written to disk.

## When the script refuses

A refusal is the tool working correctly. It stops before making
any change at all, and tells you why.

| Message | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| no account named X | The username is wrong, or the account is already gone | Check the spelling in Active Directory |
| already disabled | Somebody has handled this one before you | Read the description field for the ticket number |
| looks like a service account | This is not a person | Find the owner. It needs a different procedure |
| ticket should look like NMG-0000 | The ticket format is wrong | Use the full four digit form |
| export file is empty | The record could not be written | Check the reports folder exists and is writable |
| Disabled Users OU not found | The destination is missing | Steps 1 to 4 completed. Move the account by hand |

## What an offboarding leaves behind

- Two timestamped CSV files per account in `Evidence/`. One
  records the account, one records every group it could reach.
- One transcript per run in `Logs/`, naming every membership
  removed.
- The authorising ticket number stamped on the account
  description in Active Directory.

The CSV of group memberships is the only record that will ever
exist of what an account could reach beforehand. Active Directory keeps no
history of a removed memberships.

## Known limitations

- Three accounts were offboarded before step 5 was implemented
  and were moved into the Disabled Users OU manually afterwards.
  Their logs do not record the move.
- Handles one account per run. Bulk processing is not built yet.
- The service account check matches on a name prefix and a
  department. An unusually named service account could get past it.
