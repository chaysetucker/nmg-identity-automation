# User Account Offboarding

**Document:** SOP-IAM-001
**Author:** Chayse Tucker
**Raised under:** Ticket NMG-0203
**Approved by:** R. Ito, Privacy Office

## Purpose

Defines the complete sequence for offboarding a user account at
Northstar Medical Group. Before this document, no written
offboarding standard existed.

## Before you begin

- There is a ticket from a named requester.
- Username, display name and department all match.
- No legal hold prevents action on this account.
- The account belongs to a person, not a service.

## Procedure

### 1. Document the current state
Export every attribute and group membership to a timestamped file.
Removed memberships cannot be recovered, so the record is taken
before anything changes.

### 2. Disable the account
Blocks authentication. This is the step that reduces risk, so it
happens as early as the record allows. Stamp the description with
the ticket number.

### 3. Reset the password
A random value nobody holds. If the account is ever re-enabled by
mistake, the old credential must not still work.

### 4. Remove group memberships
Disabling removes no access. Stripping the groups means a
re-enabled account can reach nothing. Domain Users is the primary
group and is skipped.

### 5. Move to the Disabled Users OU
Quarantine, so the account is never mistaken for active staff.
Last, because moving changes the object path and invalidates
earlier references.

## Retention and disposal

Retained in the Disabled Users OU for the period the retention
policy defines, then deleted on a documented schedule. Where a
legal hold is in place the clock stops and nothing is deleted
until Counsel releases it in writing.

Disabled accounts are evidence. You disable a leaver.
You do not delete them.

## Tooling

Steps 1 and 2 of this procedure are implemented in
`Scripts/Disable-NMGUser.ps1`.

    .\Disable-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "hgrady" -Ticket "NMG-0211"

Both parameters are mandatory. The script will not run without
an authorising ticket number.

### What the tool refuses to do

The script stops, without making any change, if:

- The named account does not exist.
- The account is already disabled. Re-running would overwrite
  the existing record of who offboarded it and when.
- The account appears to be a service account rather than a
  person. Those need their own procedure, starting with
  finding an owner.
- The ticket number is not in the form NMG-0000.

### Checking before acting

The script supports `-WhatIf`. Running it with that switch
performs every check and reports what it would do, without
changing anything.

Run it with `-WhatIf` first. Every time.

### What it leaves behind

- Two timestamped CSV files in `Evidence/`, capturing the
  account and its group memberships before the change.
- A transcript in `Logs/`, recording which account was
  actioned, under which ticket, by whom, and at what time.

Steps 3 to 5 are still performed by hand. They will be added
to this script over the remainder of the week.
