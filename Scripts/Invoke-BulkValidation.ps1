<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Validates a bulk offboarding request. Changes nothing.

.DESCRIPTION
    Phase 1 reads the separations file and produces a cleaned
    copy. Phase 2 checks every remaining row against Active
    Directory and writes a report for human review.

    This script contains no command that modifies an account.
    It cannot disable, strip, move or reset anything. Acting on
    the result is a separate step, performed by a separate
    script, against the approved output of this one.

.PARAMETER InputFile
    The separations file, as received. Never modified.

.PARAMETER OutputPath
    Where the cleaned copy, the report and the approved list go.

#--- THE SKELETON -------------------------------------------
# Two phases. No third one, on purpose.
#
#  PHASE 1   read and clean      uses the file only
#  PHASE 2   check and report    uses the directory
#
#  ( no phase 3 )
#
# Friday adds the action, in a separate script, reading the
# approved list rather than this file.
#
# A script that COULD act is a script somebody will run
# without reading the report.

# Today something runs, so today there is a log.

#=============================================================
#  PHASE 1 - READ AND CLEAN. THE FILE ONLY.
#=============================================================

#--- EDIT 1: READ IT, KEEP THE ROW NUMBERS ------------------
# The row number is the cheapest thing on this page and it
# pays for itself the first time somebody queries a decision.

        Name     = $raw[$i]."Employee Name"
    }
}

#--- EDIT 2: TRIM, THEN DROP THE EMPTIES --------------------
# Trim FIRST. A username with a trailing space fails every
# test you apply to it, for the wrong reason.

#--- EDIT 3: REJECT WHAT IS NOT A USERNAME ------------------
# Lowercase letters, maybe a dot or an underscore.
# An employee ID is not a username. This catches row 19.

#--- EDIT 4: DEDUPLICATE, AFTER TRIMMING --------------------
# Order matters. Deduplicate before trimming and row 14
# slips through, because it does not look identical until
# the trailing space is gone.
