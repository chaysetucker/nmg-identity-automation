<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Performs a complete offboarding of a single Active
    Directory account, per SOP-IAM-001.

.DESCRIPTION
    All five steps: documents the account and its group
    memberships to timestamped CSV files, verifies that
    record on disk, disables the account, stamps it with the
    authorising ticket, randomises the password, removes all
    group memberships, and moves it to the Disabled Users OU.

    Refuses to act if the account does not exist, is already
    disabled, appears to be a service account, the ticket is
    malformed, the export cannot be verified, or the
    destination OU is missing.

.PARAMETER Username
    The SamAccountName of the account to offboard. Mandatory.

.PARAMETER Ticket
    The authorising ticket, in the form NMG-0000. Mandatory.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Disable-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "hgrady" -Ticket "NMG-0211" -WhatIf
    Runs every check and reports what it would do, changing nothing.
